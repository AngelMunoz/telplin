# Telplin

<blockquote class="fancy">
<p>And each day of the Valar in Aman contained twelve hours, and ended with the second mingling of the lights, in which Laure<strong>lin</strong> was waning but <strong>Telp</strong>erion was waxing.<br>
&mdash; The Silmarillion, Ch 1, Of the Beginning of Days</p>

Telplin helps F# users to **generate** matching **signature files** for implementation files.  
It uses the [F# compiler](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp) and [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) to achieve this.
