# Telplin

> And each day of the Valar in Aman contained twelve hours, and ended with the second mingling of the lights, in which Laure**lin** was waning but **Telp**erion was waxing.  
> &mdash; The Silmarillion, Ch 1, Of the Beginning of Days

Telplin helps F# users to **generate** matching **signature files** for implementation files.  
It uses the [F# compiler](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp) and [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) to achieve this.
